Marica Gerber is a certified Accountant and Auditor with 16 years of experience in the field. She holds her clients in high esteem and is dedicated to providing exceptional service at competitive rates. She takes pride in transforming her clients into valuable assets for the firm. Marica firmly believes that by collaborating, we can help your business thrive.
After completing her articles, she became a part of Deloitteâ€™s Specialized Services Group & Forensic Accounting Department. In the year 2000, she made the decision to extend her expertise to small and medium-sized enterprises. She is convinced that these businesses deserve the same high standards of service and quality that one would expect from any of the Big 4 Audit firms. Unfortunately, many small and medium businesses find it challenging to afford the fees charged by these large firms.
In addition to her CA(SA) qualification, she has earned higher diplomas in Forensic Accounting and B-BBEE with distinction. She is also a registered Master Tax Practitioner and actively participates in various continuous professional development programs.
The firm comprises herself, experienced managers from diverse fields, trainee accountants, an Advocate, and a committed team of bookkeepers. We serve as a Training Office for SAICA/IRBA trainees as well as SAIPA. Marica Gerber personally supervises all accounting and auditing tasks within the practice.
We provide conferences and seminars, most of which are complimentary for our clients. These events aim to empower you as a small or medium business owner to manage your operations more effectively and profitably. They also inform you about various legislative instruments relevant to your business and the interactive functioning of legal entities. Additionally, these gatherings offer attendees the chance to network with other businesses.
We have launched a Management Consulting Division to support your business by providing managerial insights based on Financial Data Analysis. The goal is to equip and educate business owners to make informed decisions.
